# roryj.github.io

This website is my personal website for projects, maybe blog posts, not sure what yet.
The website is currently hosted on github pages and will be updated with any push to main.

## Development

### Pre-reqs
* [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd)
* [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd)

### Run the website locally
In the root of the directory run `modd`, which will start the website for live updates.

```bash
> modd
23:22:37: daemon: devd -m ./

Route / -> reads files from ./
Listening on http://devd.io:8000 (127.0.0.1:8000)

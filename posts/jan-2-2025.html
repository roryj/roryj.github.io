			Eh there! Welcome to my new website. I don't really know what this website will end up being, but
			sitting around waiting for inspiration may take a while, so instead I am going to wing it and see
			what happens. Is this a tech related website where I write important, thought leadership articles (maybe, 
			but if you really want this I highly recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/">Marc Brooker's blog</a>),
			will I post new updates on my thoughts on Seattle's public transit plan (maybe, but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theurbanist.org/">The Urbanist</a> covers that nicely)
			and biking experience (a la <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattlebikeblog.com/">Seattle Bike Blog's got that covered</a>) new Seattle food hits? Clearly I have a lot
			of excellent ideas, and an incredibly good looking and intelligent readership (looking at you!) who wants to hear it. Win win.

			<br/>
			<p>
			For this first post, a simple list of new things that I am doing/interested in for 2025 will suffice.
			</p>
			<br/>

			<p><b>Favourite new bike infrastructure;</b></p>
			<br/>

			Big shoutout to the new MLK bike lane. When biking down to Jimi Hendrix park, Lowes, or down to Columbia City, I don't feel like I am
			dodging cars and taking plates. Would love this to stretch further North, but the current cement boulevards are
			a huge improvement. One little shoutout to the brief period of time (probably one month) where there was the cement lifted
			and bikes going North had to dodge some interesting placed barriers.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p><b>Favourite new public transit route;</b></p>
			<br/>

			This was a big year, with big projects (Link 1 Line Lynwood extension, Link 2 Line opening), but 2024 has to go to my most anticipated
			opening, the Rapid G Line. Now, this might just because of the massive amount of construction that I had to deal with over the 5 (hundred?)
			years of its development, or the many times the power or water lines were accidentaly hit by the construction crew, or the <i>countless</i>
			times I saw the construction crews opening up the exact same portion of concrete I saw them fill only weeks before. Maybe those things. But
			also this has been a big boon for getting connected to 3rd Avenue, where more of the arterial bus lines run through. Good public transit relies
			on convenience, frequency, and reliability, and this project knocks it out for me.

			<br/>
			<br/>

			That's it for now. Be back when I am back, and write more when I write more. Cheers everybody.
